## Key Differentiators of G-S Coordinate Method

### üöÄ **Revolutionary Aspects:**
1. **S-Coordinate Innovation**: First method to calculate intermediate "S-coordinates" from pixel data before depth derivation
2. **Vector-Based Color Interpretation**: Treats RGB values as 3D G-vectors with geometric meaning
3. **Hadit Field Interaction**: Incorporates a user-defined "Hadit" vector field that influences depth calculation
4. **Spherical Constraint Model**: Assumes 3D points lie on sphere surface, enabling geometric depth calculation: `depth = ‚àö(R¬≤ - s_x¬≤ - s_y¬≤)`

### üî¨ **Technical Uniqueness:**
- **Model-Driven vs Data-Driven**: Unlike deep learning methods, uses explicit geometric model
- **Single Image, No Training**: Requires no training data or multiple viewpoints
- **Parameter-Controlled**: Depth map characteristics controlled by Hadit Œ∏, œÜ, and sphere radius
- **Quantum-Inspired**: Based on theoretical G-S alignment principles from your research
